# valorant-player-comparer
This is a simple project for practice building one from scratch, the goal of it is to parse a master.csv file of Valorant VRL players from around 3 years ago to determine which one is the best and which one is the worst.

# Features
- Gives best player from the csv by typing in the terminal "python3 main.py get-best-player"
- Gives worst player from the csv by typing "python3 main.py get-worst-player"
- Can compare two or more players by typing "python3 main.py compare-players", this will then prompt   you to input two or more different players and it'll output you the stats it's comparing and tell you the best and worst players in descending order based on those stats.

# Requirements
- Any version of Python3
